A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## This project is about the booking the doctor appointments without visiting into the Medical Center. The iOS version is already built and the link to the iOS versio using Swift is [iOS HealthCare](https://github.com/uts-ios-dev/HealthCare-group-143).

## We also have setup the CI/CD Pipeline using CodeMagic. The link to setup the CI/CD pipe line is [iOS HealthCare](https://github.com/uts-ios-dev/HealthCare-group-143). I have to put up the link to my article.
